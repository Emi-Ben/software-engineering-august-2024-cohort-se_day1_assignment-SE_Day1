#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a process of birthing an solution based idea, developing it to a technologically driven standard to meet the needs of the end users whereby it addresses a challenge facing the society and also it has to do with the maintenance of the developed technology(software).
Its importance in the technology industry:
1. It helps us to solve societal challenges as have already been identified by the United Nations in the development of the sustainable development goals.
2. It serves as an enabler to making work easier for man.
3. it can be used as a tool for sustainable development.
4. It helps to bring the world closer to our reach in terms of commerce, communication, transportation, communication, entertainment, healthcare services, etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The use of the programming language C to write codes on web development which was invented between the year 1972 & 1973.
2. The advancement led to the development of C++ in 1979. All of these are man cracking his brain to write codes to be able to suit the purpose of the development he wants to do at any given time of development.
3. The use of modern Artificial Intelligence tools to aid in the writing of codes for web development and even some AI tools which can be used for web development. For example, Wix, Uizard, ChatGPT etc.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning:- Identification of a challenge and proposing a solution in the form and basis of idea.
2. Requirements:- This has to do with the developer gathering and documenting the users needs and necessary systems required to develop a solution(software) for the user.
3. Design and prototype:- This stage has to do with the developer coming up with a graphical model, algorithm or representation of how the software should look like.
4. Software development:- This  has to do with developing the software according to the users demand.
5. Testing:- This is running a test the software to ensure it is up to standard and meets up to requirements. 
6. Deployment:- Has to do with the developer sending to the users for further usage and
7. Maintenance:- Has to do with periodic routine check on the software to ensure users do not get stranded using the software and also for proper adjustment in the software when necessary.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall WHILE has to do with Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
EXAMPLES of Waterfall methodologies are requirements, design, implementation WHILE for Agile are Extreme Programming, Feature Driven Development, Scrum, etc


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs and VCS enhances productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.
 Examples of IDEs includes Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
 while
 Examples of VCS includes Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements.
2. Tight Deadlines.
3. Technical Debt.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges
1. Effective communication.
2. Agile methodologies
3. Prioritization of tasks and
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing has to do with testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System testing is a process which has to do with testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering has to do with creating a concise and specific questions into a generative artificial intelligence tool or model, to be able to get the best response as desired by the user.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: What is Quantum Physics.
Improved prompt: As Physics Professor who needs to explain to an 8 years old girl, describe the term, Quantum Physics using fun examples and practically realistic approach to bring it to her level. Include some children emojis to make her understand better.
